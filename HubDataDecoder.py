''' Hub Data Decoder
Started 21.8.16
Reads a LoRa data packet and decodes it.

Now uses logging. To add logging type
logging.level(message)
where level is either debug, info, warning, error, critical message is the text to log - can add variables into these messages
e.g.
logging.debug("Recevied this packet to decode:%s" % reply) replaces the %s with the value in reply as a string

31st Aug - Changed the data packet to be a string rather than a list.
